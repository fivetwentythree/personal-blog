### or can it be? can this be ?

Over the past year, robotics has been catching up with the LLM era. Pi’s π0.5 can clean unseen homes. Tesla’s Optimus can follow natural language cooking instructions. These systems are extremely impressive, but they feel stuck in a utilitarian mindset of robotic appliances.

For these future robots to live with us, they must be expressive. Expressiveness communicates internal state such as intent, attention, and confidence. Beyond its functional utility as a communication channel, expressiveness makes interactions feel natural. Without it, you get the textbook uncanny valley effect.

 

Earlier this year, I came across Apple’s ELEGNT paper, which frames this idea rigorously through a Pixar-like lamp to show how posture and timing alone can convey intention. Around the same time, I discovered SpiRobs, a soft tentacle robot that feels oddly alive with just simple movements. One system was carefully designed to express intent while the other just moved, yet somehow felt like it had intent. That difference was interesting. I started building Shoggoth Mini as a way to explore it more directly. Not with a clear goal, but to see what would happen if I pushed embodiment into stranger territory. This post retraces that process, the happy accidents, and what I learned about building robots.
