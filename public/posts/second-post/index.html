half-dozen <a href=https://docs.mathjax.org/en/stable/start.html#linking-your-copy-of-mathjax-into-a-web-page>nursemaids</a> with their straggling charges, an occasional girl

little spot of crimson amongst the wavering shadows of the trees, a few
hulking idlers in corduroy and bluchers, and a tipsy female sleeping
on the grass.</p><p><span class="sidenote sidenote-left">this image show how this is normaally done in the past and this is how we do it in present <img src=https://fivetwentythree.github.io/personal-blog/assets/images/1.png alt=this_is_a_new_image srcset="https://fivetwentythree.github.io/personal-blog/images/1_hu_74715f382c15d7ba.webp 200w, https://fivetwentythree.github.io/personal-blog/images/1_hu_dbf332de2fe9c193.webp 400w, https://fivetwentythree.github.io/personal-blog/images/1_hu_fee156652223f56.webp 800w, https://fivetwentythree.github.io/personal-blog/images/1_hu_a4c2d58288265806.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" loading=lazy>

there is scarcely room for one lounger more, for the rule of fashion
is so subtile a bondage, that it has compelled millions of people who
never in all their lives have spoken to one another to wear the same
order of garments, and talk the same slang, and ride in the same kind
of carriages, and eat the same class of dinners, and congregate in
the same places, at the same hour, year after year, and century after
century, from the earliest dawn of civilisation until to-day.</p><div class=highlight title=test.py><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>def</span> <span style=color:#a6e22e>hello_world</span>():

man, and our superfluous wealth must find employment somehow
or other. Hench the crush of high-stepping horses, the crowd of
three-hundred-guinea barouches; the flutter of costly garments rustling
in the summer air, the glitter and splendour which pervades every
object, until it seems almost as if the superfluous gold were melted
into the atmosphere, and all the female population were so many Miss
Kilmanseggs.</p><p>The lounger on the rails may for the moment find it almost
difficult to believe that hungry women and gaunt haggard-looking men
can have any place in the world of which this dazzling region is a
part: but he need only look backward, under the shadow of the trees, to
see poverty and crime prowling side by side in their rags.</p><p>Yet at the worst, the dazzle and the glitter are good for trade; and it is better that the tide of wealth should be rolling to and fro along the Lady&rsquo;s
Mile than locked in a miser&rsquo;s coffers or given in alms to professional
beggars at a church-door. Some part of the superfluous gold must pass
through the horny hands of labour before it can be transmuted into
C-springs or patent axles, Honiton lace or Spitalfields silk; and
perhaps the safest of all philosophy is that which accepts the doctrine
that &ldquo;whatever is, is right.&rdquo;</p></article></main><footer id=footer></footer></body></html>
