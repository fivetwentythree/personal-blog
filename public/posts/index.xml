      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was high tide&amp;ndash;spring tide, if you will&amp;ndash;at half past-six o&amp;rsquo;clock
on a warm June evening: not the commonplace ebb and flow of a vulgar
river; but the mighty tide of fashion&amp;rsquo;s wonderful sea, surging
westward, &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.mathjax.org/en/stable/start.html#linking-your-copy-of-mathjax-into-a-web-page&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; under the dusty elms and lindens of the Lady&amp;rsquo;s Mile.&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote sidenote-right&#34;&gt;
    this is a side note about this specific paragraph The pouncing
proprietor, with the leathern pouch at his side, has hard work to
collect his rents, so rapidly do his customers come and go, and is
distracted by vague fears of levanting tenants and bad debts.
&lt;/span&gt;
If you had driven round this very park between four and five on this
very afternoon, you would have been gratified by the sight of some
half-dozen &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.mathjax.org/en/stable/start.html#linking-your-copy-of-mathjax-into-a-web-page&#34;&gt;nursemaids&lt;/a&gt; with their straggling charges, an occasional girl
and perambulator, a picturesque life guardsman here and there, making a
little spot of crimson amongst the wavering shadows of the trees, a few
hulking idlers in corduroy and bluchers, and a tipsy female sleeping
on the grass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote sidenote-left&#34;&gt;
    this image show how this is normaally done in the past and this is how we do it in present &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/personal-blog/images/1.png&#34; alt=&#34;this_is_a_new_image&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote sidenote-right&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the excited policemen have enough to do to keep the
four ranks of carriages in line, and to rescue foot-passengers from
the pawing hoofs of three-hundred-guinea steeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote sidenote-right&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/personal-blog/images/4.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walk under the trees is as crowded as the enclosure at Ascot, and the iron chairs are
as fully occupied as the seats in a fashionable chapel. The pouncing
proprietor, with the leathern pouch at his side, has hard work to
collect his rents, so rapidly do his customers come and go, and is
distracted by vague fears of levanting tenants and bad debts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/personal-blog/images/2.png&#34; alt=&#34;book_cover&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On all the length of the rails between Hyde-Park Corner and the Serpentine
there is scarcely room for one lounger more, for the rule of fashion
is so subtile a bondage, that it has compelled millions of people who
never in all their lives have spoken to one another to wear the same
order of garments, and talk the same slang, and ride in the same kind
of carriages, and eat the same class of dinners, and congregate in
the same places, at the same hour, year after year, and century after
century, from the earliest dawn of civilisation until to-day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34; title=&#34;test.py&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;hello_world&lt;/span&gt;():
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    print(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Hello, world!&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are a wealthy nation, the political economist tells the poor
man, and our superfluous wealth must find employment somehow
or other. Hench the crush of high-stepping horses, the crowd of
three-hundred-guinea barouches; the flutter of costly garments rustling
in the summer air, the glitter and splendour which pervades every
object, until it seems almost as if the superfluous gold were melted
into the atmosphere, and all the female population were so many Miss
Kilmanseggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lounger on the rails may for the moment find it almost
difficult to believe that hungry women and gaunt haggard-looking men
can have any place in the world of which this dazzling region is a
part: but he need only look backward, under the shadow of the trees, to
see poverty and crime prowling side by side in their rags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet at the worst, the dazzle and the glitter are good for trade; and it is better that the tide of wealth should be rolling to and fro along the Lady&amp;rsquo;s
Mile than locked in a miser&amp;rsquo;s coffers or given in alms to professional
beggars at a church-door. Some part of the superfluous gold must pass
through the horny hands of labour before it can be transmuted into
C-springs or patent axles, Honiton lace or Spitalfields silk; and
perhaps the safest of all philosophy is that which accepts the doctrine
that &amp;ldquo;whatever is, is right.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>This can be way more beautiful</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;or-can-it-be&#34;&gt;or can it be?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, robotics has been catching up with the LLM era. Pi’s π0.5 can clean unseen homes. Tesla’s Optimus can follow natural language cooking instructions. These systems are extremely impressive, but they feel stuck in a utilitarian mindset of robotic appliances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote sidenote-right&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;this has been argued to me the most heneious crimes perpetrated by the criminals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/personal-blog/images/3.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote sidenote-left&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/personal-blog/images/2.png&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these future robots to live with us, they must be expressive. Expressiveness communicates internal state such as intent, attention, and confidence. Beyond its functional utility as a communication channel, expressiveness makes interactions feel natural. Without it, you get the textbook uncanny valley effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I came across Apple’s ELEGNT paper, which frames this idea rigorously through a Pixar-like lamp to show how posture and timing alone can convey intention. Around the same time, I discovered SpiRobs, a soft tentacle robot that feels oddly alive with just simple movements. One system was carefully designed to express intent while the other just moved, yet somehow felt like it had intent. That difference was interesting. I started building Shoggoth Mini as a way to explore it more directly. Not with a clear goal, but to see what would happen if I pushed embodiment into stranger territory. This post retraces that process, the happy accidents, and what I learned about building robots.&lt;/p&gt;
